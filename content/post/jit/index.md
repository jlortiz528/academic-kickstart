title: Spread too Thin - The Impact of Lean Inventories
summary: Lean inventory practices allow firms to raise profits by placing fewer, more frequent orders in normal times. This strategy however, renders the economy more vulnerable to an unanticipated shock. This paper documents empirical evidence of this trade-off and quantifies it in a structurally estimated hetergenous firms model.
