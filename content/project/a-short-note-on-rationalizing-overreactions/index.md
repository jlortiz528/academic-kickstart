title: A Short Note on Rationalizing Overreactions
date: 2020-07-05T19:15:37.782Z
summary: Forecast error predictability is used to motivate models of
  non-rational expectations. This note finds, however, that a rational model of
  strategic interaction can look a lot like a non-rational model. I propose a
  more robust test of linear rational expectations.
