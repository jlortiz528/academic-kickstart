title: "Nonlinear Expectations: Making Sense of Professional Forecasts"
date: 2020-07-05T19:11:37.238Z
summary: Professional forecasters tend to over- and underreact to different
  macroeconomic variables. I build a model of nonlinear rational expectations

  underreactions is the underlying signal-to-noise ratio.
