abstract: Lean production generates a tradeoff between micro stability and macro vulnerability. Examining public “just-in-time” (JIT) firms, I find that JIT producers experience higher sales growth and less volatility. At the same time, JIT producers are more cyclical and sensitive to natural disasters. Motivated by these facts, I build and structurally estimate a general equilibrium model in which heterogeneous firms can adopt JIT. The estimated model implies that while JIT producers enjoy a 1.0% increase in steady state firm value, an unanticipated disaster akin to the COVID-19 shock results in a 1.1 percentage point sharper output contraction relative to a counterfactual economy with less adoption. In the estimated model, previously lean businesses hoard materials and rebuild stocks of now highly valuable inventories, disrupting their production processes.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Lean inventory practices allow firms to raise profits by placing fewer, more frequent orders in normal times. This strategy however, renders the economy more vulnerable to an unanticipated shock. This paper documents empirical evidence of this trade-off and quantifies it in a structurally estimated heterogeneous firms model. (Draft coming soon)
