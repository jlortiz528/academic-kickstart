abstract: This paper introduces a novel finding about professional forecasters--the same respondent simultaneously over- and underreacts to distinct macroeconomic variables. Whereas standard models struggle to make sense of this fact, I show that simultaneous over- and underreactions can arise in nonlinear environments. In such contexts, rational forecasters are unable to obtain an optimal and exact estimate of the state via the Kalman filter. I consider stochastic volatility as the source of nonlinearities and assume that forecasters must approximate the state by selecting an approximation function from a set of costly alternatives. According to my model, over- and underreactions depend crucially on the the underlying signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, the scope for overreactions is decreasing in the signal precision. I conclude that error predictability is not prima facie evidence against rationality.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Professional forecasters tend to over- and underreact to different macroeconomic variables. I build a model of nonlinear rational expectations that is able replicate this fact. I find that the key determinant of over- and underreactions is the underlying signal-to-noise ratio.
