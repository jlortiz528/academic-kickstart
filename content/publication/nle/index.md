abstract: Among professional forecasters, the same respondent simultaneously over- and underreacts to distinct macroeconomic variables. I show that these empirical patterns can arise in nonlinear environments, where rational forecasters are unable to obtain an optimal and exact estimate of the state via the Kalman filter. I consider stochastic volatility as the source of nonlinearities and assume that forecasters must approximate the state by selecting an approximation function from a set of costly alternatives. According to my model, over- and underreactions depend crucially on the the underlying signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, the scope for overreactions is decreasing in the signal precision. I conclude that error predictability is not prima-facie evidence against rationality.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Professional forecasters tend to over- and underreact to different macroeconomic variables. I build a model of nonlinear rational expectations that is able replicate this fact. I find that the key determinant of over- and underreactions is the underlying signal-to-noise ratio.
