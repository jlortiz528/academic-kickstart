abstract: Among professional forecasters, the covariance between forecast errors and revisions can be negative or positive depending on the macroeconomic variable in question. I show that these apparent over- and underreactions can arise simultaneously in a noisy information environment with unobserved volatility and heterogeneity in forecasting models. Under such dynamics, the use of different models among forecasters can be rationalized by costly adoption of more sophisticated methods. The scope for overreactions is found to be decreasing in the signal-to-noise ratio. I provide empirical evidence and calibration results consistent with this mechanism and conclude that modeling relevant nonlinearities can serve as a way of making sense of the observed heterogeneity in reported forecasts.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Professional forecasters tend to over- and underreact to different macroeconomic variables. A model that incorporates unobserved time varying volatility is able replicate this fact. I find that a key determinant of over- and underreactions is the underlying signal-to-noise ratio.
