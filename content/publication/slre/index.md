abstract: We show that updates to macroeconomic expectations among professional forecasters exhibit an offsetting pattern where increases in current-quarter predictions lead to systematic decreases in three quarter ahead predictions. We then review evidence of individual overreaction at the quarterly frequency and document a lack of overreaction at the annual frequency. We explain these facts with a model of annual anchoring in which quarterly predictions must be consistent with annual predictions. We estimate our model to fit survey expectations and show that it provides a unified explanation for our empirical facts. Furthermore, our model yields frequency-specific estimates of information frictions which imply a larger role for inattention at the annual frequency.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Updates to survey expectations exhibit an offsetting pattern that are incompatible with standard theories of belief formation. We rationalize this in a model featuring annual inattention and a quarterly-to-annual consistency constraint. Our model offers a new explanation for observed overreactions in expectations.
