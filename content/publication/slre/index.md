abstract: We document that updates to macroeconomic expectations among professional forecasters are: (i) negatively serially correlated at the individual level, (ii) positively serially correlated at the aggregate level, and (iii)  exhibit an offsetting pattern. To explain these facts, we build and estimate a model featuring annual smoothing and a requirement that quarterly predictions be jointly consistent with the annual forecast. Relative to existing theories, our model provides a unified explanation for the three facts as well as other forms of over and underadjustment. Furthermore, our model suggests that annual forecasts exhibit more information rigidity than quarterly forecasts, with a larger role for sticky information relative to noisy information.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Professional forecast revisions exhibit an offsetting pattern that is incompatible with standard theories of expectation formation. We rationalize this in a model featuring long-run inattention and a consistency constraint (requiring that short-term predictions aggregate to the outdated longer-run outlook). Our offsetting revisions model provides a new explanation for observed overreactions in expectations.
