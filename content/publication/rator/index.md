abstract: Using data from professional forecasters, I find that a theory of misspecified expectations, in which forecastersâ€™ perceived law of motion differs from the objective law of motion, outper- forms alternative models in its ability to fit prediction errors and revisions. Misspecification is successful in part because it matches updating behavior in the data. My framework delivers a novel testable implication through which I provide robust evidence of misspecification-related overextrapolation across a range of macroeconomic variables. I conclude that misspecified expectations can serve as a suitable benchmark alternative to full information rational expecta- tions.

summary: A theory in which forecasters adopt parsimonious models of richer underlying processes can serve as a suitable benchmark departure from full information rational expectations.
