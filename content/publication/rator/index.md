abstract: Error predictability is a salient feature of survey data and serves as a motivation for departures from full information rational expectations (FIRE) models. Within the set of non-FIRE models, however, there are several theories consistent with the error predictability. I offer an additional fact that can serve to further distinguish between models of belief formation: the persistence of overlapping revisions. Intuitively, non-FIRE models featuring Bayesian updating require that revisions about fixed events be serially uncorrelated. By way of example I show that this fact, when applied to the Survey of Professional Forecasters, favors a model of diagnostic expectations over a model of strategic interaction.
