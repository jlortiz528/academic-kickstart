## Course Description

Does taking an econometrics class in college improve job prospects? To what extent do friends determine your outcomes in life? Are married people happier? Are kids going to lag behind if both parents work? What factors determine the timing of retirement? We can use econometrics to answer questions like these, and others in a wide variety of fields. Econometrics is the use of statistical tools to answer questions using economic or other data. The main objective of economists to use econometrics is to deduce causality.
This is the second course in the introductory level sequence in empirical economic analysis. More specifically, this course will introduce you to the tools needed to do empirical work, namely, a data set, econometric skills, and computer software. By the end of this class, you should be able to pose a question, develop a hypothesis, and analyze your hypothesis using available data, and econometric skills developed in class. Topics covered in this class include simple and multiple linear regression models, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and panel data. I would love for you to learn econometrics for the sake of learning, however, as an additional motivation, I should add that the skills that you learn in this class are greatly valued in the job market.
