## Course Description

This course explores the causes and consequences of international trade. We begin by posing some guiding questions to focus on throughout the session such as why nations trade, what they trade, and who gains from trade. The session will be divided into three parts. The first part will be devoted to acquiring the skills to answer the questions above. To that end, we begin with a focus on learning the tools of trade theory. The second part of the session will be devoted to analyzing trade policy. The final part of the session will explore additional topics in international trade such as the effects of trade on the labor market and broader topics related to globalization.
