## Flexibility

This course explores the causes and consequences of international trade. We begin by posing some guiding questions to focus on throughout the session such as why nations trade, what they trade, and who gains from trade. The session will be divided into three parts. The first part will be devoted to acquiring the skills to answer the questions above. To that end, we begin with a focus on learning the tools of trade theory. The second part of the session will be devoted to analyzing trade policy. The final part of the session will explore additional topics in international trade such as the effects of trade on the labor market and broader topics related to globalization.

## Delete tutorials

**To remove these pages, delete the `courses` folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.**

## Update site menu

After renaming or deleting the `courses` folder, you may wish to update any `[[main]]` menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at `config/_default/menus.toml`.

For example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:

```toml
[[main]]
  name = "Courses"
  url = "courses/"
  weight = 50
```
## Update the docs menu

If you use the *docs* layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form `[menu.X]` where `X` is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the `courses/example/` folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within `courses/example/` from `[menu.example]` to `[menu.<NewFolderName>]`.
