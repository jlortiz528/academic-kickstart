## Flexibility

This course will focus on the essential questions about functioning of most economies around the world. We will emphasize the differences between outcomes over the short term, and the path of the economy over the long term. We will learn what policymakers can and cannot to help the economy get out of a crisis. In addition, we look at issues such as the role of the banking system and the advantages and disadvantages of trading with other countries. This course will provide you with a solid understanding of the economy, help you understand different views of different political parties and allow you to evaluate the short and long-term effects of proposed and implemented policies.

## Delete tutorials

**To remove these pages, delete the `courses` folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.**

## Update site menu

After renaming or deleting the `courses` folder, you may wish to update any `[[main]]` menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at `config/_default/menus.toml`.

For example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:

```toml
[[main]]
  name = "Courses"
  url = "courses/"
  weight = 50
```
## Update the docs menu

If you use the *docs* layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form `[menu.X]` where `X` is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the `courses/example/` folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within `courses/example/` from `[menu.example]` to `[menu.<NewFolderName>]`.
